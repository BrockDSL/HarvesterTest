So it also registers taps you make that aren't on links or something. Personally I don't really see how this violates the rules. I could totally see this being useful information to adjust the design. The researcher is alleging that this data is unnecessary, and it is harmful because it can be used to fingerprint users.\n\nFingerprinting is when you track someone by collecting lots of 'harmless' data and then combining it so that you can uniquely identify someone. For example there might be 100 thousand users in Stockholm who use Firefox. But only 10 thousand users in Stockholm who use firefox and have Adblock plus. And there might only be 1 user in Stockholm who uses firefox version 1.273, adblock plus version 3.128, lastpass version 2.389 and who has dark mode, and whose computer doesn't have the font Arial Sans Banana. Even though each of those pieces of info is harmless, if you get enough of it you get a unique 'fingerprint'. And the bad thing is that you can't turn off that fingerprint. \n\nBut the researchers argument feels very hollow to me because he\n\n1. Acknowledges that Apple writes this in their TOS\n2. Acknowledges that this behavior is fine with Apples app tracking rules\n3. Ignores that the you need to be logged in to use the app store, meaning the entire threat of fingerprinting is sort of silly. It is like complaining someone might find out what your name is when you have a tattoo of your name on your forehead.\n4. He specifically says \"If this data is linked with data from 3rd parties, Apple could theoretically track users\", which sort of strikes me as \"If they lie, then this could be dangerous\". True, but also kind of obvious and a non issue. Again, they already have your account.
