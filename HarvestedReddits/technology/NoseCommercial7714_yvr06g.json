NASA shut down the STS, got to turn all that supporting money away to other, more pure-science projects, and slowly chased a public-accessible rocket launch system design. \n\nThe USAF/NRO finally got their tiny, stealthy, easy to throw over the pole or park in weird orbits version of the STS they'd always wanted, and since no crew, no life support, way less to put up there, way more delta-V on-orbit, it was just win-win-win-win-win for the USAF/NRO, and it got NASA out of the spying game and back to more mundane science stuff.\n\nI can't imagine NASA having much use for an X-37. It's cool and can do all sorts of crazy spy shit and hang out in space for a year or three, but it's nowhere near useful for a lot of the human-supported, short-duration, heavy science work that NASA likes to do.
