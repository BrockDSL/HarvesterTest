Is Jeff Bezos some godlike uberman that conceived of ideas no other human could fathom or worked miracles beyond the capacity of human societies? Is that why we allow him to accumulate so much wealth?

And regarding technological advancements, should automation only benefit the few? \n\nYou can choose to believe that it's a fair return on his initial investment. I'm just not sure how you justify it. \n\nCapital moves from the bottom up and accumulates at the top. Everytime you purchase a good you are paying a greater value than the total inputs for that good. Likewise, when you work, you are paid a lesser value than the total inputs of your labor. When you save your money in a bank you are only receiving a tiny fraction of the value they generate from your savings as return interest. Where do you think that extra value goes each time? It moves up the chain of capital. So, when someone becomes obscenely wealthy, it's only by exploiting many people that they acquire such disproportionate wealth. We don't call it exploiting because people willingly sign up for it, but they haven't much recourse.\n\nThe only way to truly gain wealth is to take advantage of this system in some manner either through owning stock or starting your own company so that you can take value from other people's efforts or needs. Living below your means accumulates very little wealth on its own without using the system to maximize that capital by taking value from others.
