Road rage?

Single lane where we were, though. \n\nThis chick, after creating a bunch of congestion- blatantly brake checked me lol. Thank god I was piecing together that she was like, intentionally driving erratically and for some asinine reason trying to mess with, idk, me specifically or maybe just anyone on the road. I am not sure. But I was already alert enough to be prepared for some more dumbassery, but I don\u2019t think I  necessarily anticipated a straight, foot to the board brake check. \n\nAnd thank fucking god for my cars sensors because with the brake assist, and the beeping alarms/signals, I was able to smoothly respond with no impact or actual incident to speak of. \n\nBut I was HEATED with the brake check, and the lane split into two just after so I rolllllled the fuck up beside her car, rolling my window, demanding to know what the fuck was up with her driving and behavior on the road, that she could have caused an accident. Its blurry from the rage but I said something like \u201cwhat the *FUCK* are you doing brake checking on a highway????? While you are already going too slow for the roadway!\u201d And she goes \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to brake check you if you were driving so crazy\u201d fucking so matter of fact admitting to the brake check, so clear about her conscious decision to do that lol \n\nAdmits to brake checking, which never mind puts her liable for anything that could have happened, but when she admitted to it I lost my shit more, talking about my kids being in the car. (Sorry, but I ain\u2019t the one, I\u2019m not a crazy driver by any means, I know this because I\u2019m regularly made fun of for it by people who ride with me or I\u2019m mobbing with.)\n\nThen she said \u201cIf you have your kids with you, you need to be driving better! I had to brake check you because you were driving too fast and I have my daughter in the back seat too!!!\u201d \n\nOh, then I saw red (we were stopped at a stop light btw) and kept screaming bloody murder about how the person she put most in danger there was her *innocent child* and she, in her little sedan compared to my SUV, who on *earth* would brake check with their little child being fucking sandwiched between the two. \n\nShe drove off while I was yelling about her being a moron for pretty much only endangering her child, I still can\u2019t get over that, obviously. It\u2019s been making me sick ever since it happened. \n\nI know brake checking really isn\u2019t that serious to most people but she could have caused an accident between not only us, but the other cars that were riding *my* ass because she was creating so much congestion with her driving.
