When I got into crypto in 2010, from my recollection it was ~$11. Crypto capped at $60,000. That's a 545354.545% increase. Now, that is not the value today, but frankly that is an *absurd* increase in returns. Even if you compare the current price to the $11 valuation of Bitcoin in 2010-2011,  it's a 152545.5% increase.\n\nThe intrinsic value of crypto is that people believe it will go up. That's it. It's a hype based economy. It's *incredibly* stupid, but it's literally backed by people's emotions. That's why the volatility is insane. People are fickle as shit. When people look at crypto and they see that it's irrational, they aren't wrong, they're completely correct, and that's because it's purely based on feelings.\n\nIf you enter the crypto market, you have to be prepared for the insane volatility. It can be a feature and not a bug only if framed and used correctly. Treat it like a casino, go in with a set amount that if it busts you don't chase your losses and flip from coin to coin consistently. My friend started with $3k and still has 30k(10x profit down from his high of over 100k).\n\nStonks most certainly do not always go up, and the flaw with crypto holders is that they are extremely resistant to selling. They think there will be infinite growth, which is completely detached from reality. To beat the crypto market, you have to get that specific emotion out of it. Sell frequently and jump from altcoin to altcoin to capitalize on the volatility.\n\nI got out of the game because I'm broke rn and I know not to bother at this time, especially with the even worse volatility than usual. I don't have my finger on the pulse of the crazy since I have been tuned out for a while.\n\nI don't think crypto is dead, because these crisises have happened over and over before, with everyone saying cryptos death is imminent, and every time they're wrong. It's surprisingly resilient for something that by all logic *should* die. I think the price will drop for a while, and then hit a low point, then rebound. It's done it again and again and again. At this point I just look at it like a function of crypto trading. A crash will always happen temporarily at some point when some news event happens, then it inexplicably goes back up. Crypto interest with guaranteed returns does not exist and should never be how crypto profits should be actualized. Anyone doing that is a sucker and is 100% participating in a Ponzi/pyramid scheme. The only legitimate way(as in one that works) to make money off it is to treat it like stock day trading with way crazier volatility. The crashes are inevitable, but crypto is the zombie that everytime you try to kill it it just gets back up again.\n\nEdit: to the downvoters, you do realize I think crypto is inherently dumb right?
