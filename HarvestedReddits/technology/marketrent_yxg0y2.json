There should be no price for digital products beyond the price paid.  It is zero overhead, compared to physical.   \n\nThe whole thing is a scam.  What people don't understand is that this is America's new type of monopoly. A monopoly that is a little more difficult to touch. The middleman Monopoly.  A monopoly of arbitrage.  The problem here is that it's not just tickets that this occurs with.\n\nEverybody blames big pharma for example whatever that is, for the prices of say, me as a type 1 diabetic, insulin.\n\nBut no this is just the ticketmasters of pharmaceuticals, and healthcare, and hospital visits and MRI usage and pretty much anything healthcare.\n\nContract negotiations which demand discounts on services by insurances, the Monopoly they hold over the customer base not simply over the customers themselves, but more so against, as Ticketmaster with the venues, almost any healthcare spending that must occur.  \n\nPBMs for example, purchase as an arbitrar of sorts, drugs from pharma companies at a reduction in price from \"adjusted price\" which I'll explain in a moment.   They then sell these adjusted priced products to the pharmacies.  Making a bit off the top.  These are often associated by the pharmacy or insurance company.  They further negotiate a voucher program, rebates.  It looks about like this.  \n\nDrug a, drug b.  \n\nEach need 50$ to make the money needed at base level for pharma company.  \n\nDrug A negotiates 90% rebate program with insurer A.  \n\nInsurer talks to drug b company.  \n\nUsing their secondary monopoly of customers. Suggest better rebates from drug company b, for drug b, at risk if losing \"preferred status\" in the state.  \n\nThis makes company offer 92% rebate voucher.\n\nFor diabetics this is of which the country has 30 million, 7 million requests from daily insulin.   About 23% of diabetics.  So let's say in Illinois with 1.3 million diabetics, thus is about 299-300k.  At 50$ a bottle that is 15,000,000 every 1-4 weeks depending on how much they take.  This may be way off (maybe too conservative) as I use 2.5 bottles a month, and I know some who use 1 and another using 3.5 or so.  So we'll use 2 as the median, but maybe off...I don't know.\n\nSo at 2 bottles a month for Illinois that preferred brand can increase dramatically the number of sales to those 300,000 diabetics, with few people willing to spend more for a brand they themselves prefer with a coat increase of non preferred drugs through their insurance copay.  That's a loss or gain of a large portion of that 30,000,000.  So the discounts are quite large as they outbid their competitor for the higher rebate percentages to gain that preferred status.  \n\nBut you ask, insulin isn't $50.    Well yeah it kind of is.   Let's say the 50$ amount is correct ( this is roughly what a bottle of old style insulin that is non prescription is out of pocket.  Truly between 35 and 50 depending.  So may be 25-50 they need to make each.  I will go with 50 for math being easier.  \n\n$50 \u00d7 8% [of 92% rebate] =  $4. \n\n$50 \u00f7 4 = 12.5 \n\n$50 \u00d7 12.5 = $625\n\nAnd now we have the insulin price.  \n\nSo at a rebate of 92% \n\nPBM buys drugs at full price 625$ for each bottle.  \n\nSells to pharmacy for some profit.  \n\nInsurance pays full price plus some profit for the pharmacy.  \n\nInsurance pays pharmacy a negotiated percentage to the \"preferred pharmacy\" so maybe 500$ a bottle, diabetic pays 20$ copay or however much.  \n\nSo insurance paid 480$ for this bottle for one single bottle rx purchase. Depending on insurance a single copay may cover whole Rx for 3mo or per bottle only.  Probably state dependant.  So let's just say 480 for maths sake.  \n\nWell insurance now has paid 480$ and contacts the pharma company for their rebate...based on the  market price paid by the PBM.  Resulting in (625\u221250)\u2212480 = 95$ profit per bottle for the insurance company.  \n\nSo pharmacy company catches flack for doing the necessary to ensure insurances will even cover it, as this can really hurt revenue if competitor is preferred.  Then PBM skins some revenue for their arbitrage when selling to the pharmacies, then the pharmacy gets their little bump, and then the insurance profits from paying for insulin, while charging you 800$ a month for insurance.   So everyone gets a piece but the patient and the least guilty are blamed.   \n\nYes some pharma companies have done shady shit (epi pen bullshit for example).  But all of them contend with this with the internal and external customer facing insurance and pbn distributed monopoly, but is it illegally a monopoly of the ones being price bashed are the suppliers not the customer if the customer suffers the price hike implemented by the third part manufacturer?  I don't think so.  \n\nThis is why pharmaceutical companies don't go under when they are only paid $50 by the NHS or Canada.   Bottles of insulin cost about 50$ in Canada for what is 12\u00d7 the cost in the states.  \n\nIt is  also why pharma companies offer discount cards that work just like insurance at the pharmacy. Because the total price isn't what they really look for.  It is rarely paid and it might be nice but it's not their profit model, unless they are scandalous like the EpiPen lady or others like them.\n\nTLDR;.  Shorter but still long \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThis is America's more recent monopolistic profit model, a multi-party monopolistic system where costs are driven up by multiple players involved but it also makes it difficult to prove antitrust since there really doesn't need to be direct communication between all the parties as the prices are driven up at different steps from where they actually result in being paid.  \n\nIt's what Ticketmaster does and it is also the effect that Ticketmaster has on the third party sales.  \n\nIt's what the insurance industry does, since everyone is required to have health insurance, they can drive the prices of the drugs up without affecting the customer in such a manner because those who can't afford the drug are in violation of the requirement to have insurance it makes it harder make that case as antitrust.  Yet they drive up the market not at all unlike Ticketmaster.   \n\nYou're not our preferred drug, but you got a bunch of money.  \n\nYou're not using ticketmaster, well you can't play it these venues where we have contracts.  \n\nBut the customer is who suffers", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1668683646.0, "parent_id": "t1_iwp0f4p", "replies": [{"author": "Diablo689er", "id": "iwplf8t", "score": 3, "subreddit": "technology", "author_flair": null, "submission": "yxg0y2", "stickied": false, "body": "Thanks for sharing this fascinating look into drug pricing.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1668686685.0, "parent_id": "t1_iwph9sk", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "Rangizingo", "id": "iwpizcm", "score": 3, "subreddit": "technology", "author_flair": null, "submission": "yxg0y2", "stickied": false, "body": "The best is the \u201cconvenience\u201d fee for having a digital ticket.
