There's no algorithm designed by a team of psychologists trying to figure out how to give you steady dopamine hits to keep your engagement up on the site. The best thing to do is think of something you're interested in, some topic, and search it. Find some people who are talking about it, follow a few of them. Do that a few more times. Now you end up with something similar to what you might have on Reddit if you nuke the front page popular subs, and just add in niche subs you're interested in.\n\nThe best description I can come up with for Mastodon is it's like a combination of e-mail, RSS feeds, and newsgroups.
