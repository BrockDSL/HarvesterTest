Foundational skills with trouble shooting goes a long way and can be applied to code and other system issues that you may face in your future. Along with trouble shooting, you will get documenting skills which will help you solve issues tasters and learn more. \n\n*Disclaimer: pursuing a IT Desktop Support is a good move, but you have to be very careful not to get stuck in support, drive yourself to get in, learn skills then move up*\n\nProgramming Advice:\nTo get into programming more, it\u2019s going to be a lot more independent work in my opinion. There are not a lot of entry level programming job/software development jobs. But learning code is different with everyone but in my experience, try to learn through solving problems: I want my code to do this function, what steps can make to solve this issue? \n\nAbove all, document everything.
