If the airline fails, planes don't just vaporize. The airports, airplanes, baggage carts, tools, etc. etc will still be there. The market will still.be there, whatever bit of the market is left, anyway. That means people will still.need to get from airport A to airport B. The failing airline has *nothing* to do with the need for travelers to get from A to B. All that will change is that in order for the VERY MUCH STILL EXISTING airplanes to carry the WAITING CUSTOMERS will be for some new company to come in and operate them. Surely the old airline didn't do something right, and surely the assets will get sold for a lot less than the original airline paid for them, and perhaps the market will shrink some as travelers and investors are unsure of how things will shake out. It just seems like allowing the failing airline to fail and a new company to take on the assets and try to serve the customer to s will lead to a more optimal fit to he market than to try to prop up the company that clearly couldn't serve the market correctly to begin with.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1668454884.0, "parent_id": "t1_iwd0u7r", "replies": [{"author": "WurthWhile", "id": "iwdb8jy", "score": 7, "subreddit": "technology", "author_flair": null, "submission": "yv3y7f", "stickied": false, "body": "I work in finance. I can answer that pretty well for you. When a company goes through bankruptcy You're going to see a disruption in services. That disruption could last anywhere from days to months or longer in some cases. Now a perfect example on that is hostess. They declared bankruptcy and it took something like a year before you started seeing Twinkies again. Even though a company almost  immediately bought them and began production again. \n\nWith an airline if they don't get bailed out they'll have to shut down and start liquidating assets which will cause mass layoffs in a disruption to their service. If other airlines are doing poorly they won't be able to help that one airline out. So what you'll do is you'll see a short term disruption of service which could cause airlines to have a chain reaction and spread the problem further. Similar to covid supply disruptions if an airline shuts down and suddenly you can't deal with all the travelers every other method of transportation is going to start struggling, and with it costs can begin the skyrocket as the remaining places begin turning down customers and simply telling them that they're not going to be visiting there grandparents for Christmas, and that package with their cancer medication is not going to be delivered until next month. \n\nNow while the airlines would be problematic if that happened financial service places would be catastrophic. The financial sector is heavily interlinked. One can't shut down without the others feeling it. Imagine trying their swipe your credit card at McDonald's and you can't because the bank that process is MasterCards funds is going through bankruptcy and Because it's not a small business that you can simply switch banks overnight it means your credit cards aren't going to be working for a few weeks or longer. So when someone like you tries to buy gas and can't because the banks aren't working you're then not showing up for work which means that grocery store distribution Center you work at might not be able to open, Which means the grocery stores can't open, Which means the business isn't making money and can't pay its employees anymore, and so on. \n\nThe economy is heavily interlinked. It's not really possible for any critical thing to just shut down even temporarily.\n\nPeople like to argue that it's a free market, but it's a regulated market for a reason.
